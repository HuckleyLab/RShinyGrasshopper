### Exploring relationships between time, growing degree days, and grasshopper phenology

In the second exercise, you can again select one or more grasshopper species and one or more sites (elevations) to plot. Two kinds of figures will be generated: On the left, you’ll see data showing which day of the year your chosen population reached adulthood in relation to how warm the growing season was that year. For example, a data point located at 200 on the x-axis and 180 on the y-axis reflects a population that reached adulthood on day 180 in a year when the summer season had 200 growing degree days. 

On the right, you’ll see data showing how much accumulated heat your chosen population had experienced before reaching adulthood, again in relation to how warm the growing season was that year. For example, a data point located at 300 on the x-axis and 200 on the y-axis reflects a population that reached adulthood after it had experienced 200 growing degree days, in a year when the summer season had 300 growing degree days. A relatively horizontal line suggests that the population tended to reach adulthood after experiencing the same amount of accumulated heat, no matter how warm or cool the season was.

Try to answer some of the following questions by changing the data you plot:

1. Plot the data for all species at site 2591m. In cool vs. warm years, do the dates at which grasshoppers reach adulthood change?  
    1.1 What about the amount of accumulated heat they experience before reaching adulthood?
    1.2 Is this different for early vs. late-season grasshoppers (see the table above)?  
    
2. How does the date at which M. dawsoni reaches adulthood change with seasonal warmth?  
    2.1 Is this different at low vs. high elevations, and why might this be?  

3. How does the amount of accumulated heat M. dawsoni experiences before reaching adulthood change with seasonal warmth?  
    3.1 Is this different for early vs. late-season grasshoppers?  
 
4. How does the amount of accumulated heat experienced by C. abdominalis when it reaches adulthood change with seasonal warmth?  
    4.1 Is this different at low vs. high elevations, and why might this be?
