### Visualization 2: Exploring relationships between time, growing degree days, and grasshopper phenology

In this visualization, you can again select one or more grasshopper species and one or more sites (elevations) to plot. Two kinds of figures will be generated: On the left, you’ll see data showing which day of the year your chosen population reached adulthood in relation to how warm the growing season was that year. For example, a data point located at 200 on the x-axis and 180 on the y-axis reflects a population that reached adulthood on day 180 in a year when the summer season had 200 growing degree days. 

On the right, you’ll see data showing how much accumulated heat your chosen population had experienced before reaching adulthood, again in relation to how warm the growing season was that year. For example, a data point located at 300 on the x-axis and 200 on the y-axis reflects a population that reached adulthood after it had experienced 200 growing degree days, in a year when the summer season had 300 growing degree days. A relatively horizontal line suggests that the population tended to reach adulthood after experiencing the same amount of accumulated heat, no matter how warm or cool the season was.
