# Alexander grasshopper resurvey
Introduce species and sites
Concepts:
early and late seaosn species, developmental plasticity
elevation gradient, greater temperature change at higher elevation

General hypotheses for cliamte change responses

## Development trajectories

We used a development index (DI), which represents the average development stage of the population and ranges from 1 (all first instars) to 6 (all adults), to describe the developmental trajectory and stage of populations.

Development hypothesis

Select species, sites, time period, and predictor variables to test hypotheses
